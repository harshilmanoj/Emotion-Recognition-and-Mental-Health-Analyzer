# Emotion-Recognition-and-Mental-Health-Analyzer

**Project Overview:**
Your project, the "Emotion Recognition and Mental Health Analyzer," is a software application that takes a video input, analyzes it using a dataset, and asks users a questionnaire. Here's a detailed breakdown of how it works:

**Step 1: Video Input**
- The project starts by taking a video input. This can be either real-time video or pre-recorded footage of a person's behavior or facial expressions.

**Step 2: Dataset**
- Your project uses a dataset that contains video frames or frame features along with corresponding emotions. This dataset serves as the training data for your model. It helps your system understand what different emotions look like in video frames.

**Step 3: Emotion Analysis**
- The video frames are analyzed to recognize emotions. This is where machine learning techniques come into play. You can use algorithms like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) or other image analysis techniques to identify emotions in the video frames. For example, the system can recognize when someone is smiling (indicating happiness) or frowning (indicating sadness).

**Step 4: Questionnaire**
- After analyzing the video, the system can prompt the user to answer a questionnaire. This questionnaire consists of questions related to the user's feelings, emotions, or experiences. It helps gather additional context about the user's mental state.

**Step 5: Mental Health Analysis**
- With the information collected from the video analysis and the questionnaire, the project performs a comprehensive analysis of the user's emotions and mental health. If the video frames and questionnaire responses suggest potential issues with the user's mental health, the system can provide recommendations or guidance.

In summary, your project combines video processing, machine learning, and user interaction to understand and assess a person's emotions and mental health. It's a valuable tool for gaining insights into an individual's well-being. If you have specific questions or need assistance with any part of this project, please feel free to ask.
